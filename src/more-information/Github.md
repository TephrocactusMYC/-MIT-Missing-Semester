# Github
GitHub is the single largest host for Git repositories, and is the central point of collaboration for millions of developers and projects.

About Github, you should know a few things.

## Account
You should know how to setup an account, no matter it is personal or organizationnal.

## Project
Learn how to find and contribute to a Project. Advanced operation is to maintain a project.

## API
I don't think APIs are commonly used.

## Github Pages
It is what I think an open source developer would better know.

You get one site per GitHub account and organization,
and unlimited project sites.

I setup Pages for almost every repositry of mine. I really love this.
