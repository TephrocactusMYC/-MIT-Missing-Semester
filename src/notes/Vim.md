# Philosophy of Vim
Vim is a modal editor: it has different modes for inserting text vs manipulating text. Vim is programmable.

# Modal editing
Vim’s design is based on the idea that a lot of programmer time is spent reading, navigating, and making small edits, as opposed to writing long streams of text. For this reason, Vim has multiple operating modes.

- Normal: for moving around a file and making edits
- Insert: for inserting text
- Replace: for replacing text
- Visual (plain, line, or block): for selecting blocks of text
- Command-line: for running a command
