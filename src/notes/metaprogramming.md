# Most of all
This article introduces the concept of metaprogramming and its applications in code construction, testing, and dependency management. The author explains the concepts and usage of build systems, as well as related technologies such as version control, dependency management, and continuous integration.

More thing about `Makefile` are [here](../more%20information/makefile.md).

# Continuous integration systems
I think the most interesting part of this section is the management of version numbers. For example, 8.0.1, where 8 is major, 0 is minor, and 1 is fix. This means that when you only update small versions, others using your code may not need to rush to update it. However, updating a major version often brings compatibility issues. I finally understand how to read version numbers and find it very interesting; I will do it like this in the future too.
# CI
Continuous integration systems is interesting.
