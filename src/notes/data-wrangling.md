# Data wrangling
The main content of this lecture is about how to process data, that is, how to obtain the results we want from the raw large amount of data.

*I don't know why but I feel this lecture a little bit boring, I prefer pandas or SQL.Maybe I do not notice the meaning of handling data on the server.*

# The content

- Regular expressions
- sort \ uniq
- awk *(It is funny)*
- paste

awk is a programming language that just happens to be really good at processing text streams.
