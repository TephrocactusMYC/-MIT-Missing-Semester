1. For this course, you need to be using a Unix shell like Bash or ZSH. If you are on Linux or macOS, you don’t have to do anything special. If you are on Windows, you need to make sure you are not running cmd.exe or PowerShell; you can use Windows Subsystem for Linux or a Linux virtual machine to use Unix-style command-line tools. To make sure you’re running an appropriate shell, you can try the command echo $SHELL. If it says something like /bin/bash or /usr/bin/zsh, that means you’re running the right program.
```shell
myc@myc-virtual-machine:~/Desktop$ echo $SHELL
/bin/bash
myc@myc-virtual-machine:~/Desktop$
```
2. Create a new directory called missing under /tmp.
```shell
myc@myc-virtual-machine:~/Desktop$ cd /tmp
myc@myc-virtual-machine:/tmp$ mkdir missing
myc@myc-virtual-machine:/tmp$ ls
missing
myc@myc-virtual-machine:/tmp$
```
3. Look up the touch program. The man program is your friend.
```shell
man touch

TOUCH(1)                        User Commands                        TOUCH(1)

NAME
       touch - change file timestamps

SYNOPSIS
       touch [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       Update  the  access and modification times of each FILE to the current
       time.

       A FILE argument that does not exist is created empty, unless -c or  -h
       is supplied.

       A  FILE  argument string of - is handled specially and causes touch to
       change the times of the file associated with standard output.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory  for  short  options
       too.

       -a     change only the access time

       -c, --no-create
              do not create any files

       -d, --date=STRING
              parse STRING and use it instead of current time
 Manual page touch(1) line 1 (press h for help or q to quit)
```
4. Use touch to create a new file called semester in missing.
```shell
myc@myc-virtual-machine:/tmp$ cd missing
myc@myc-virtual-machine:/tmp/missing$ touch semester
myc@myc-virtual-machine:/tmp/missing$ ls
semester
myc@myc-virtual-machine:/tmp/missing$
```
5. Write the following into that file, one line at a time:
>```
>#!/bin/sh
>curl --head --silent https://missing.csail.mit.edu
>```
The first line might be tricky to get working. It’s helpful to know that # starts a comment in Bash, and ! has a special meaning even within double-quoted (") strings. Bash treats single-quoted strings (') differently: they will do the trick in this case. See the Bash quoting manual page for more information.

```shell
myc@myc-virtual-machine:/tmp/missing$ echo '#!/bin/sh' > semester
myc@myc-virtual-machine:/tmp/missing$ cat semester
#!/bin/sh
myc@myc-virtual-machine:/tmp/missing$ echo "curl --head --silent https://missing.csail.mit.edu" >> semester
myc@myc-virtual-machine:/tmp/missing$ cat semester
#!/bin/sh
curl --head --silent https://missing.csail.mit.edu
myc@myc-virtual-machine:/tmp/missing$
```
7. Try to execute the file, i.e. type the path to the script (./semester) into your shell and press enter. Understand why it doesn’t work by consulting the output of ls (hint: look at the permission bits of the file).
```shell
myc@myc-virtual-machine:/tmp/missing$ ls -l
total 4
-rw-rw-r-- 1 myc myc 62  5月 30 14:30 semester
myc@myc-virtual-machine:/tmp/missing$
```
*Why "月" exits here? My Ubuntu had set English Language for all.*
8. Look up the chmod program (e.g. use man chmod).
```shell
man chmod

CHMOD(1)                        User Commands                        CHMOD(1)

NAME
       chmod - change file mode bits

SYNOPSIS
       chmod [OPTION]... MODE[,MODE]... FILE...
       chmod [OPTION]... OCTAL-MODE FILE...
       chmod [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents the GNU version of chmod.  chmod changes
       the file mode bits of each given file according to mode, which can  be
       either  a symbolic representation of changes to make, or an octal num‐
       ber representing the bit pattern for the new mode bits.

       The format of a symbolic mode is [ugoa...][[-+=][perms...]...],  where
       perms  is either zero or more letters from the set rwxXst, or a single
       letter from the set ugo.  Multiple symbolic modes can be given,  sepa‐
       rated by commas.

       A  combination of the letters ugoa controls which users' access to the
       file will be changed: the user who owns it (u),  other  users  in  the
       file's  group  (g),  other  users  not in the file's group (o), or all
       users (a).  If none of these are given, the effect is as if  (a)  were
       given, but bits that are set in the umask are not affected.

       The  operator  + causes the selected file mode bits to be added to the
 Manual page chmod(1) line 1 (press h for help or q to quit)

```
9. Use chmod to make it possible to run the command ./semester rather than having to type sh semester. How does your shell know that the file is supposed to be interpreted using sh? See this page on the shebang line for more information.

Last problem show us that , user myc has no permission to execute file semester.

So, here are two methods at least:

fisrt:
```shell
myc@myc-virtual-machine:/tmp/missing$ chmod 777 semester
myc@myc-virtual-machine:/tmp/missing$ ls -l
total 4
-rwxrwxrwx 1 myc myc 62  5月 30 14:40 semester
myc@myc-virtual-machine:/tmp/missing$
```
Second:
```shell
myc@myc-virtual-machine:/tmp/missing$ chmod +x semester
myc@myc-virtual-machine:/tmp/missing$ ls -l
total 4
-rwxrwxr-x 1 myc myc 62  5月 30 14:30 semester
myc@myc-virtual-machine:/tmp/missing$
```
Notice, the only difference between two methods is that the permission of other user. You could find more information in [my blog]().
10. Use | and > to write the “last modified” date output by semester into a file called last-modified.txt in your home directory.

You need to use grep.
```shell
myc@myc-virtual-machine:/tmp/missing$ ./semester | grep last-modified > ~/last-modified.txt
myc@myc-virtual-machine:/tmp/missing$ cat ~/last-modified.txt
last-modified: Sat, 06 May 2023 11:21:52 GMT
myc@myc-virtual-machine:/tmp/missing$

```
11. Write a command that reads out your laptop battery’s power level or your desktop machine’s CPU temperature from /sys. Note: if you’re a macOS user, your OS doesn’t have sysfs, so you can skip this exercise.

In [Chinese solution](https://missing-semester-cn.github.io/missing-notes-and-solutions/2020/solutions/course-shell-solution/), it shows the laptop battery’s power level. But I use  VMware virtual box, so I can not find my battery or CPU temperature. WTF???(awesome!)

I think you could search in google for more information about this problem.
