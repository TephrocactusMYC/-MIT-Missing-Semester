1. If you don’t have any past experience with Git, either try reading the first couple chapters of Pro Git or go through a tutorial like Learn Git Branching. As you’re working through it, relate Git commands to the data model.

Notes are [here](../more%20information/Pro-Git.md)
2. Clone the repository for the class website.
```shell
┌─[myc@ubuntu22]─[~/Desktop]
└──╼[16:48:08]$ git clone https://github.com/missing-semester/missing-semester.git

2. 1. Explore the version history by visualizing it as a graph.

    ```shell

    2. Who was the last person to modify README.md? (Hint: use git log with an argument).
    ```shell
    16:52 $     git log -1 README.md
    commit 9ef9db72211fefc00caaa7133b35dda4a99acccf

        Add Docker setup for easier development
    ✔  ~/Desktop/missing-semester [master|✔ ]
    ```
    3. What was the commit message associated with the last modification to the collections: line of _config.yml? (Hint: use git blame and git show).
    ```shell
    ✔  ~/Desktop/missing-semester [master|✔ ]
    16:52 $ git blame _config.yml | grep collections
    a88b4eac (Anish Athalye 2020-01-17 15:26:30 -0500 18) collections:
    ✔  ~/Desktop/missing-semester [master|✔ ]
    16:52 $
    ```

3. One common mistake when learning Git is to commit large files that should not be managed by Git or adding sensitive information. Try adding a file to a repository, making some commits and then deleting that file from history (you may want to look at this).

Using
```shell
git filter-branch
```
to clean up commit history.

for example:
```shell
git filter-branch --force --index-filter\
'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch ./my_password' \
--prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
```

4. Clone some repository from GitHub, and modify one of its existing files. What happens when you do git stash? What do you see when running git log --all --oneline? Run git stash pop to undo what you did with git stash. In what scenario might this be useful?

The Git stash command can temporarily store current uncommitted changes, allowing for a clean workspace to switch branches and fix bugs before retrieving the stored changes with git stash pop.

5. Like many command line tools, Git provides a configuration file (or dotfile) called ~/.gitconfig. Create an alias in ~/.gitconfig so that when you run git graph, you get the output of git log --all --graph --decorate --oneline. Information about git aliases can be found here.


6. You can define global ignore patterns in ~/.gitignore_global after running git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global. Do this, and set up your global gitignore file to ignore OS-specific or editor-specific temporary files, like .DS_Store.

```shell
[alias]
    graph = log --all --graph --decorate --oneline
```
7. Fork the repository for the class website, find a typo or some other improvement you can make, and submit a pull request on GitHub (you may want to look at this). Please only submit PRs that are useful (don’t spam us, please!). If you can’t find an improvement to make, you can skip this exercise.
