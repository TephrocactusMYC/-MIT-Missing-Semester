# Exercises
## Job control
1. From what we have seen, we can use some ps aux | grep commands to get our jobs’ pids and then kill them, but there are better ways to do it. Start a sleep 10000 job in a terminal, background it with Ctrl-Z and continue its execution with bg. Now use pgrep to find its pid and pkill to kill it without ever typing the pid itself. (Hint: use the -af flags).

2. Say you don’t want to start a process until another completes. How would you go about it? In this exercise, our limiting process will always be sleep 60 &. One way to achieve this is to use the wait command. Try launching the sleep command and having an ls wait until the background process finishes.However, this strategy will fail if we start in a different bash session, since wait only works for child processes. One feature we did not discuss in the notes is that the kill command’s exit status will be zero on success and nonzero otherwise. kill -0 does not send a signal but will give a nonzero exit status if the process does not exist. Write a bash function called pidwait that takes a pid and waits until the given process completes. You should use sleep to avoid wasting CPU unnecessarily.
```shell
┌─[myc@ubuntu22]─[~/Desktop]
└──╼[23:56:26]$ sleep 60 &

## Terminal multiplexer
1. Follow this tmux tutorial and then learn how to do some basic customizations following these steps.

It is so complex! BUT NOW I am already familiar with this tool.
## Aliases
1. Create an alias dc that resolves to cd for when you type it wrongly.
```shell
┌─[myc@ubuntu22]─[~]
└──╼[00:06:34]$ alias dc=cd
┌─[myc@ubuntu22]─[~]
└──╼[00:06:36]$ dc Desktop/
┌─[myc@ubuntu22]─[~/Desktop]
└──╼[00:06:44]$
```
2. Run history | awk '{$1="";print substr($0,2)}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10 to get your top 10 most used commands and consider writing shorter aliases for them. Note: this works for Bash; if you’re using ZSH, use history 1 instead of just history.
```shell
┌─[myc@ubuntu22]─[~]
└──╼[00:07:05]$ history | awk '{$1="";print substr($0,2)}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
      2 line = line ";" $i;
      2 pgrep sleep
      2 print line;
      3 cat /usr/share/dict/words | tr "[:upper:]" "[:lower:]" | grep -E "^([^a]*a){3}.*$" | grep -v "'s$" | sed -E "s/.*([a-z]{2})$/\1/" | sort | uniq -c | sort | tail -n3
      3 cd Desktop/
      3 curl https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/topic-pages/tables/table-1 | sed -n '/<table/,/<\/table/p' | sed -n '/<tr>/,/<\/tr>/p' > data.txt
      4 }
      4 su
      5 curl 'https://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/TablesWikipediaZZ.htm' | sed -n "/table1/,/<\/table>/p" | grep "<tr" | sed -E 's/(<[^>]*>)+/ /g' | sed 's/ /-/g;s/&nbsp;/ /g' > data.txt
      5 ls

## Dotfiles
Let’s get you up to speed with dotfiles.

1. Create a folder for your dotfiles and set up version control.
2. Add a configuration for at least one program, e.g. your shell, with some customization (to start off, it can be something as simple as customizing your shell prompt by setting $PS1).
3. Set up a method to install your dotfiles quickly (and without manual effort) on a new machine. This can be as simple as a shell script that calls ln -s for each file, or you could use a specialized utility.
4. Test your installation script on a fresh virtual machine.
5. Migrate all of your current tool configurations to your dotfiles repository.
6. Publish your dotfiles on GitHub.

~~ALL QUESTION ARE SO EASY! I will redo this assignment once I finish writing more dotfiles.~~
```shell
$ mkdir ~/gits/dotfiles   # gits目录是创建用来存放所有git及github仓库的目录
$ git init ~/gits/dotfiles # 将本机的配置文件，如 .vimrc/.bashrc/.tmux.conf 等复制进该目录
```
```shell
$ git clone

$ vim autoconfig.sh   # 创建脚本
$ cat autoconfig.sh
#!/bin/bash
files=$(ls -a $1 | grep -E '.[^.]+' |grep -v .git)
# 去掉 ls -a 返回结果中的 ". .. .git"
for file in `echo $files`; do
    ln -s $1/$file ~/$file # 创建软链接
done

$ source autoconfig.sh
# 执行脚本，为dotfiles中的配置文件创建在主目录 ~ 下的软链接
```
## Remote Machines
Install a Linux virtual machine (or use an already existing one) for this exercise. If you are not familiar with virtual machines check out this tutorial for installing one.

1. Go to ~/.ssh/ and check if you have a pair of SSH keys there. If not, generate them with ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519. It is recommended that you use a password and use ssh-agent , more info here.

```shell
┌─🌵[myc@ubuntu22]─[~]
└──╼[00:33:00]$ ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519
┌─🌵[myc@ubuntu22]─[~]
└──╼[00:34:04]$ ls .ssh
id_ed25519  id_ed25519.pub  id_rsa  id_rsa.pub  known_hosts  known_hosts.old
```
2. Edit .ssh/config to have an entry as follows
```
 Host vm
     User username_goes_here
     HostName ip_goes_here
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
     LocalForward 9999 localhost:8888
```

I use UbuntuDesktop to connet Ubuntu Server. :)
```shell
Host vm
  User myc
  HostName 192.168.85.131
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
  LocalForward 9999 localhost:8888
```


3. Use ssh-copy-id vm to copy your ssh key to the server.

```shell
┌─🌵[myc@ubuntu22]─[~]
└──╼[00:35:36]$ ssh-copy-id vm
The authenticity of host '192.168.85.131 (192.168.85.131)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:6KgPSnRcSlySxeuU1QmuFjnw2qvYvYGEUkpNFoXZrXM.
This key is not known by any other names
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 2 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
myc@192.168.85.131's password:

Number of key(s) added: 2

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'vm'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.

4. Start a webserver in your VM by executing python -m http.server 8888. Access the VM webserver by navigating to http://localhost:9999 in your machine.

```shell
myc@ubuntu22[16:38:04]:~$ python3 -m http.server 8888
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8888 (http://0.0.0.0:8888/) ...

5. Edit your SSH server config by doing sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config and disable password authentication by editing the value of PasswordAuthentication. Disable root login by editing the value of PermitRootLogin. Restart the ssh service with sudo service sshd restart. Try sshing in again.

**It is not recommended to use root login.**
6. (Challenge) Install mosh in the VM and establish a connection. Then disconnect the network adapter of the server/VM. Can mosh properly recover from it?

After disconnecting the network adapter, neither SSH nor Mosh connections can be restored actively (the virtual machine's network connection method needs to be modified again).

7. (Challenge) Look into what the -N and -f flags do in ssh and figure out a command to achieve background port forwarding.
```shell
-N      Do not execute a remote command.  This is useful for just forwarding ports.

-f      Requests ssh to go to background just before command execution.  This is useful if ssh is going to ask for passwords or passphrases, but the user wants it in the background.  This implies -n.  The recommended way to start X11 programs at a remote site is with something like ssh -f host xterm.

If the ExitOnForwardFailure configuration option is set to ``yes'', then a client started with -f will wait for all remote port forwards to be successfully established before placing itself in the background.
```

```shell
ssh -fN -L 9999:localhost:8888 pi
```
